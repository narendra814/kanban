Subject: Kanban Board Implementation - Task Completed ✅
Hi Team,
I'm happy to report that I've successfully completed the custom drag-and-drop Kanban board implementation as requested. The project has been built with all the required features and functionality.
Features Implemented

✅ Column and task data fetched from API (with mock API for testing)
✅ Drag-and-drop functionality for tasks between columns
✅ Column reordering with drag-and-drop
✅ Real-time persistence of changes to the backend
✅ Optimistic updates for improved user experience
✅ Full keyboard accessibility and screen reader support

Technical Details

Used @hello-pangea/dnd (a maintained fork of react-beautiful-dnd) for compatibility with React 19
Implemented custom hooks for state management
Added accessibility enhancements for keyboard navigation
Created a mock API service that can be easily swapped with real endpoints
Added responsive design elements for various screen sizes

Next Steps
The codebase is ready for review. To integrate with our actual backend services, we'll need to:

Replace the mock API endpoints in the api.js file
Test with actual data
Implement any additional features identified during review

Please let me know if you'd like me to walk through the implementation or if there are any adjustments needed before we consider this task complete.
The project structure follows our standard patterns, with components, services, and utilities properly separated to ensure maintainability.
Thanks,
[Your Name]
P.S. I encountered and resolved some compatibility issues with React 19 during implementation, so feel free to reach out if anyone on the team needs guidance on working with drag-and-drop in newer React versions.
